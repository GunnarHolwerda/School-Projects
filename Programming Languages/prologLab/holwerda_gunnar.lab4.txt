16) Name something you like about Prolog. Explain.
	I am not really a fan of anything about prolog. I mean in this lab it was nice to be able to think about things logically and they worked as you intended them.

17) Name something you dislike about Prolog. Explain.
	I like figuring out the problem instead of describing it. And Prolog just allows you to describe the problem and it figures it out for you. And any math stuff is impossible.

18) Did you enjoy this lab? What aspects did you like and/or dislike?
	I don't like prolog, so I didn't enjoy the lab. I wish that you would have given examples of what some correct answers would have been for queries so that we knew if we were on the right track. I liked that it was rather simple.

19) Approximately how many hours did you spend on this lab?
 	~2 hours

 20) Do you think you will use Prolog agin? For which type(s) of project(s)?
 	No I will not. Not a fan.
