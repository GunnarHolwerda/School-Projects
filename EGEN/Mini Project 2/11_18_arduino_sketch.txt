 You can use the Arduino serial monitor to view the sent data, or it can
 be read by Processing, PD, Max/MSP, or any other program capable of reading 
 data from a serial port.  The Processing code below graphs the data received 
 so you can see the value of the analog input changing over time.
 
 The circuit:
 The salinity sensor is attached to A5.
